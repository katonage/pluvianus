    "<img src=\"https://github.com/katonage/pluvianus/blob/main/pluvianus%20image.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"right\">\n",
    "A feature-rich brosing, editing GUI for manual data verification and acceptance of CaImAn results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Seeing is believing...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlights\n",
    "* Standalone GUI\n",
    "* Interactive scatter plot of component metrics\n",
    "* Computing and visualizing original data over extracted traces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "* TBD\n",
    "Install with pip into an environment: `pip install pluvianus`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To run pluvianus, type `python pluvianus` in your terminal.<br>\n",
    "To get started, open an HDF5 file (Ctrl+O) exported by the CaImAn package, and its Data Array (Ctrl+D) (mmap file). Note that other HDF5 and mmap files are not supported.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The GUI comprises of 3 parts:\n",
    "* On the top is the Temporal Widget, which displays the components' activity data as a function of time\n",
    "* In the bottom left-hand corner is the Scatter Widget, which displays the evaluation of every component through 3 metrics\n",
    "* In the bottom right-hand corner is the Spatial Widget, which displays the components' outlines and spatail positions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Widget\n",
    "Select a component under \"Component\" or click inside an outline in the Spatial Widget. You can limit which components you can see when stepping between them with the \"Limit to\" selector (all, good, or bad).<br>\n",
    "Under \"Plot\", you can view two quantities of the component as a function of the frame count. These quantities are normalized and detrended. The quantitites are:\n",
    "* F_dff: Signal-to-baseline ratio\n",
    "* C: Temporal component\n",
    "* S: Spike count estimate\n",
    "* YrA: Residual\n",
    "* R: ???\n",
    "* Others if computed (see \"Tool Bar\" section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the quantity selector you can apply a running average over the data with a specified amount of frames.<br>\n",
    "The \"Y fit all\" button will scale the plot so that every Y value fits into the view. You can also manually pan and zoom inside the graph:\n",
    "* Press and hold left click to pan\n",
    "* Scroll with the mouse wheel to uniformly zoom in and out\n",
    "* Press and hold right click to zoom on a specific axis:\n",
    "    * Move the mouse horizontally to zoom in and out of the timeline\n",
    "    * Move the mouse vertically to zoom in and out of the vertical axis\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected quantities' values are displayed on the vertical axis. The first quantity's (graphed blue) appears on the left side of the view, the second's (graphed red) on the right side.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Zoom\" centers view on the largest peak on C, and zooms in on the timeline, showing a section whose length corresponds to decay time. Selecting \"Auto\" will do this automatically when selecting another component.<br>\n",
    "You can automatically fit every graph horizontally and vertically by pressing the \"A\" button in the lower left-hand corner which appears when hovering inside the view.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the metrics of the selected component under the zoom option:\n",
    "* Rval: Spatial footprint consistency\n",
    "* SNR: Signal-to-noise ratio\n",
    "* CNN: Convolutional Neural Network score\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the view you can scroll through the timeline by dragging the blue rectangle, or step through frames one-by-one with the buttons left of the timeline. This also displays the frame you are currently on.<br>\n",
    "Right of the timeline you can see the timestamp of the selected frame and also specify a window around it (see \"Spatial Widget\" section).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By right clicking on the view you can export it to various formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scatter Widget\n",
    "A 3D scatter plot with axes for the three metrics displays the evaluation of every component. Hovering over the components inside the plot shows their index and the three metrics. Clicking on the component brings it up in the Temporal Widget and highlights it in the Spatial Widget. On the scatter plot itself, the selected component is displayed as a bigger dot.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Left of the plot are the assignments and thresholds. With \"Assignment\" you can manually set the selected component good or bad, regardless of other factors.<br>\n",
    "Under \"Thresholds\", you can specify two thresholds for every component, one low and one high. The thresholds named \"lowest\" are the low thresholds. A component is good if it exceeds all low thresholds and at least one high threshold (unless you manually set it to be bad). The thresholds are represented with dashed lines on the plot. Press \"Evaluate\" to count the number of good and bad components with the default thresholds, or set new thresholds, and recount with \"Evaluate\". Good components are represented by green dots, while bad ones are red.<br>\n",
    "\"Totals\" tells you how many components CaImAn found, and how many are good or bad based on the thresholds and manual setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Widget\n",
    "The Spatial Widget displays the recorded region of interest with the contours of the components. Like on the scatter plot, good outlines are green, while bad ones are red.<br>\n",
    "Pan on the displayed image by pressing and holding left click, and zoom in where your cursor is by scrolling. Fit the image by pressing the \"A\" button in the lower left-hand corner<br>\n",
    "You can change the image's colormap on the right.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Under \"Display\" you can display quantities spatially at any given frame. The quantities are:\n",
    "* A: Spatial position of selected component\n",
    "* Data: Original data\n",
    "* Residuals\n",
    "* RCM: Reconstructed movie\n",
    "* RCB: Reconstructed background\n",
    "* B0, B1: Background components\n",
    "* sn: ???\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Temporal Widget, under the quantity selector you can spatially average the image. Temporal averaging is done by setting the window around the selected frame.<br>\n",
    "Zoom centers view on selected component, with zoom corresponding to neuron diameter. Selecting \"Auto\" will do this automatically when selecting another component.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Under \"Contours\" you can specify which components' contours you want to see.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By right clicking on the view you can export it to various formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compute\n",
    "\"Compute\" lets you compute various quantities:\n",
    "* Detrend ΔF/F: detrends signal-to-baseline ratio data. You can view this by choosing F_dff under \"Plot\" in the Temporal Widget. Calls the cnm.estimates.detrend_df_f() function\n",
    "* Compute Component Metrics: (re)computes the three metrics used for component evaluation. Calls the cnm.estimates.evaluate_components(images, self.cnm.params, dview=dview) function\n",
    "* Compute Projections: computes the temporal Mean, Max and STD images. You can view these under \"Display\" in the Spatial Widget. You can also save them to npy files by going to \"Files\"\n",
    "* Compute Local Correlation Image: you can view it under \"Display\" in the Spatial Widget, and save it to an npy file by going to \"Files\". Calls the local_correlations_movie_offline function, and returns the output's maximum\n",
    "* Compute Original Fluorescence Traces: Calculates the fluorescence of every component individually, and the fluorescence of every pixel not belonging to any component. You can view the former by choosing Data under \"Plot\" in the Temporal Widget, and the latter by choosing Data neuropil. The former is computed by masking the components' outlines, and averaging the fluorescence inside these masks over time. The latter is computed in the same way, only the outsides of the masks are considered\n",
    "* Compute Maximum of Displayed Movie: ???\n",
    "\n",
    "### Export\n",
    "\"Export\" lets you export various data:\n",
    "* C: npy, either all components or only good ones\n",
    "* ΔF/F: npy, either all components or only good ones\n",
    "* Countours: MEScROI, only good components\n",
    "\n",
    "Pluvianius itself saves into an HDF5 file, retaining both the original data and all additional calculations made.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended usage\n",
    "* TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future plans\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next\n",
    "* step components sorted according to metrics\n",
    "* displaying all component's temporal curves together (gray), mouse click event on that to select component\n",
    "* Movement correction of raw files from OnACID pipeline\n",
    "* Edit parameters of the compute menu options\n",
    "* command line calling with filename and datafile\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expertiese wanted\n",
    "* support of 3D data\n",
    "* Packaging and distribution\n",
    "* Documentation\n",
    "* marketing in/to CaImAn community\n",
    "* ask for CaImAn dependencies - shold we optimize the environment?\n"
